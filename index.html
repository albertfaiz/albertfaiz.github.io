								<h2>Statement of Teaching Philosophy</h2>
							</header>
							<div class="card">
								<h3>1.1 Introduction and Personal Journey</h3>
								<p>My teaching journey is encouraged by my eagerness to learn and my passion for inspiring students to achieve their goals. Over more than a decade of teaching—from physics and mathematics to language instruction across elementary to pre-undergraduate levels—I have developed a philosophy that centers on the belief that students are our future. I am convinced that guiding them to innovate, shape policy, and implement solutions is one of the most significant contributions we can make to creating a better world. Teaching is an ever-evolving journey, with no single formula for success, which makes it both exciting and immensely rewarding.</p>
								<p>I clearly remember the moment I realized that teaching was my true calling. After graduating from the University of Chittagong, I initially balanced elementary school teaching with a side clothing business. Despite the financial rewards of the business, I found that my thoughts were continually occupied with lesson plans and grading papers. In the classroom, I felt an unparalleled sense of purpose and lost all awareness of the outside world. Even when I once taught five to seven classes a day, I remained energized and motivated. Ultimately, I decided to leave the business behind and devote myself entirely to teaching—a decision that has only deepened my conviction and passion for education.</p>
								<p>I take great pride in watching my students succeed on a global scale. Many have gone on to study at the world’s leading universities, some have graduated and embarked on teaching careers of their own, while others have made remarkable strides in innovation, technology, and business. Although there is still much to accomplish, I find immense fulfillment in knowing that through teaching, I have the opportunity to guide and shape the minds and lives of future generations.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="card">
								<h3>1.2 Core Teaching Principles</h3>
								<h4>1.2.1 Blending Theory with Practice</h4>
								<p>I like to show students that knowledge is best understood when theory is grounded in real-world contexts. In a typical class say on projectile motion, for instance, learners might:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Derive fundamental equations from everyday scenarios (e.g., throwing a basketball).</li>
									<li>Validate those equations via a low-cost lab experiment, highlighting the gap between ideal assumptions and observed data.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>By actively measuring, analyzing, and interpreting, students gain deeper conceptual understanding.</p>
								<h4>1.2.2 Long-Term Skills over Rote Learning</h4>
								<p>Physics can overwhelm students with formulas. Instead, I place emphasis on:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Analytical Thinking: Encouraging comparisons of multiple solution paths.</li>
									<li>Self-reflection: Students keep brief “learning journals” to reflect on why a method worked (or didn’t).</li>
									<li>Frequent, Low-Stakes Assessments: I call them CCQ: Concept Check Question: Quick quizzes or concept checks help me identify misconceptions early.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>This approach fosters problem-solving resilience rather than short-term memorization.</p>
								<h4>1.2.3 This is what an observer would see in my class: Student-Centered Engagement</h4>
								<p>My classrooms revolve around what students do—they solve problems in groups, present intermediate steps on the board, and critique each other’s logic. Observers often notice the lively dynamic: it is not me simply delivering content, but the students themselves taking the lead in discovering and articulating key ideas.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="card">
								<h3>1.3 Reflection and Adaptation</h3>
								<p>I regularly gather feedback via:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Mid-semester anonymous surveys to see which activities students find most helpful.</li>
									<li>Observations by peers or external visitors (e.g., donors at AUW).</li>
									<li>Personal teaching diaries documenting each lesson’s successes and challenges.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>These reflections shape my subsequent lessons. My goal is to remain, in essence, the “first student” in the room—continually refining my practices based on real data and student experiences.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="card">
								<h3>1.4 Role of Technology</h3>
								<p>Tools like Khan Academy or interactive simulations can enrich learning if used judiciously. I often assign short online lessons before class, freeing up in-class time for deeper, collaborative problems. Real-time data acquisition in labs (even using phone sensors) motivates students to see how theory translates into quantifiable evidence.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="card">
								<h3>1.5 Evidence based learning</h3>
								<p>I make sure that students are learning in class and there is evidence of that. Evidence sometimes I collect individual work, group work, or peer work. Sometimes I ask them concept check questions, short quizzes activities, and presentations. I try to observe them closely and look for their misconception and knowledge gaps. I then explain things that they will need to know and guide them to further resources online and in the library so that they can learn and see the bigger picture of what they are looking for and precise concepts where they have areas of improvement.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="card">
								<h3>1.6 At UTD what I do</h3>
								<p>Since Fall 2023, I have served as a Teaching Assistant in the Electromagnetism Lab at UTD. Each week, we follow a well-defined syllabus and set of instructions that ensure consistency and clarity for both instructors and students. Every Monday at 9:30 AM, I meet with the professor to set up the equipment and review the objectives of the upcoming lab session. This collaborative approach ensures that all preparatory work aligns with the established guidelines and helps students achieve the intended learning outcomes.</p>
								<p>In the lab, I adhere closely to the detailed lab manuals and encourage students to explore the material within that framework. I am responsible for grading three key components of their work: the lab report, the pre-lab assignment, and the homework. At the start of each session, I introduce the equipment, outline the lab’s goals, highlight any safety precautions, and clearly explain the concepts that will be explored. This approach not only keeps students focused but also helps them appreciate the importance of each experimental step.</p>
								<p>I include this experience in my teaching philosophy because I hold a deep respect for well-established, time-tested instructional methods. Before joining UTD, I was part of a team that developed syllabi and policies through years of experimentation and collaboration among dedicated educators. I understand firsthand the value of these carefully crafted guidelines, which are the result of extensive effort and expertise by our professors. Additionally, I actively provide feedback when I observe student insights that may warrant the professor’s attention, ensuring that our teaching practices continue to evolve and improve.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="card">
								<h3>1.7 Conclusion</h3>
								<p>Ultimately, my teaching philosophy focuses on fostering curiosity, connecting theory to tangible experiences, and building a culture of collaboration. By centering the classroom around what students actively do—experimenting, discussing, and reflecting—I see clear evidence that they become more confident, motivated, and better prepared for the rigorous demands of both advanced studies and real-world challenges.</p>

									<h4>Comments on Ratings</h4>
									<p>These consistently high marks reflect the <strong>student-centered</strong> approach I adopt. Specific praise often cites the <strong>structured group work</strong>, <strong>prompt feedback</strong>, and <strong>positive classroom environment</strong> that encourages risk-taking (making mistakes, then learning from them).</p>
									<h4>Comments from supervising professor</h4>
									<p>My supervising professor Dr. Lamya Saleh, and Dr. Paul Mac Alevey has made encouraging comments on performance in multiple occasions. I always like to go one step ahead to facilitate the students and experiment on methods to improve the lab experience at UT Dallas. Dr. Paul Mac Alevey made the following rewarding comment: Hi Faiz,.. many thanks for doing all that you have. Now we have video evidence it the effect not being nearly as visible as before! Thank you. Take care. Dr. Lamya Saleh wrote: Dear Faiz, I think this is exactly what Dr. Mac Alevey wanted everyone to see. He has done this himself many times but meant for it to allow all to see patterns or ideal conditions, if any! The answer to this question can be very helpful as you work with your students in the labs. Hope we can get more input from all of you guys. Thank you Faiz for putting the effort to provide the group with many trials. Take care, This is an event where I have done hours of experiments by myself to see the behavior of pairs of electrostatic apparatus in the lab. In the comments from my supervising professors, all the other TAs are cc’ed including our lab manager. This encouragement motivates me to do more such additional work for the university.</p>
